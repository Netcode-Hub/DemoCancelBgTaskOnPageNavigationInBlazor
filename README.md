# Effortlessly Cancel Blazor Background Tasks on Navigation with NetcodeHub's Quick Solution!

Today, we're diving into a crucial aspect of Blazor development: how to effectively cancel background tasks when a user navigates to another page. This is a common scenario that many developers encounter, and handling it correctly is essential to ensure a smooth user experience and to avoid unnecessary resource consumption.

Imagine this: You're working on a Blazor application that fetches data from an API call. Your user navigates to a different page while the data is still loading. Without proper handling, that background task continues to run, consuming resources and potentially causing unexpected behavior.

But don't worry, there's a simple solution! I'm excited to introduce you to a small but powerful NuGet package I developed called NetcodeHub.Packages.Components.BackgroundTaskStopper. This package wraps the necessary functionality to easily cancel those background tasks, making your Blazor applications more efficient and responsive.

# NetcodeHub.Packages.Components.BackgroundTaskStopper
### Description
Introducing **NetcodeHubTaskManager** ‚Äì a robust and efficient component for managing background tasks in your Blazor applications. With this package, you can ensure that any ongoing background operations are promptly canceled when a user navigates away from the component, freeing up resources and improving the responsiveness of your application. Say goodbye to lingering tasks and hello to streamlined performance with the NetcodeHubTaskManager.

### Release Notes

#### Version 1.0.0

**Initial Release:**

- **Background Task Cancellation**: Automatically cancels background tasks when the user navigates away from the component, ensuring that your application remains efficient and responsive.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates into your existing Blazor components with minimal setup.
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently manages and disposes of `CancellationTokenSource` to prevent memory leaks and ensure optimal performance.
- **Simple API**: Provides a straightforward API to monitor and cancel background tasks with ease.

# Usage Example:
    @using NetcodeHub.Packages.Components.BackgroundTaskStopper
    @inject HttpClient Http
    @inherits NetcodeHubTaskManager
    @code{
       protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
       {
           forecasts = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>("https://localhost:9888/weather", ComponentMonitor());
       }
     }

 
# Handling Code In Different File
```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;
using NetcodeHub.Packages.Components.BackgroundTaskStopper;

public class YourComponent : NetcodeHubTaskManager
{
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var token = ComponentMonitor();
        try
        {
            await SomeLongRunningTask(token);
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            // Handle task cancellation
        }
    }

    private async Task SomeLongRunningTask(CancellationToken token)
    {
        // Your long-running task logic here
    }
}
```
# Handling With Same Component Name as Class
    partial class Weather: NetcodeHubTaskManager
    {
        private WeatherForecast[]? forecasts;
        [Inject] public HttpClient HttpClient { get; set; } = new();
        protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
        {
            forecasts = await HttpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>("https://localhost:9888/weather", ComponentMonitor());
        }
    }

# Inherit the Class in the Component
    @page "/weather"
    @using NetcodeHub.Packages.Components.BackgroundTaskStopper
    @inherits NetcodeHubTaskManager 
    <PageTitle>Weather</PageTitle>
